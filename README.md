# My Nearby Hotels We App
This app utilizes the Google Maps Javscript API's places and maps libraries to get your current location and then search for nearby
restaturants and displays them on the map and list.
It is made using [Vue 3 JS](https://vuejs.org/)

# Instructions
1. Clone the repo
2. Copy .env.example file to .env and add your Google Maps API key. [Create one here](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
3. Install npm modules and start dev server.

```cmd
cp .env.example .env
echo "YOUR_API_KEY" >>> .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

NOTE: You should have a valid Google Maps API key with the places and maps libraries enabled.
